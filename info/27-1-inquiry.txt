Environment:

Server specs is UNIX running WebSphere IBM behind HTTP server.

Browser specs is IE7+.

When trying to to request BiominiWebAgent.js - SCRIPT5 error shows up in the console.


Suggestable fixes:
- Instead of using jQuery, use vanilla JS XML Domain request or w/ jsonp

// create pure js (w/ activex)


// jsonp - activex
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IE settings:
- security on middle
- wgproxy - lan settings 8080 (when removed, the response was recieved)
- all webservices are being run on unix
- all js are rendered on ^
